# This file describes collections of data and trained model weights that are
# released with MHC2flurry. We refer to these datasets as "downloads."
#
# Downloads are organized into "releases", which generally correspond with
# MHC2flurry releases of the same version.
#
# When users run "mhc2flurry-downloads fetch" without specifying any downloads
# by name, the downloads with "default=true" are downloaded.

# This should usually be the latest release.
current-release: 0.0.1

# An integer indicating what models the current MHC2flurry code base is compatible
# with. Increment this integer when changes are made to MHC2flurry that would break
# the use of previously released models.
current-compatibility-version: 1

# Add new releases here as they are made.
