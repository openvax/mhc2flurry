# This file describes collections of data and trained model weights that are
# released with MHCflurryII. We refer to these datasets as "downloads."
#
# Downloads are organized into "releases", which generally correspond with
# MHCflurry releases of the same version.
#
# When users run "mhcflurryii-downloads fetch" without specifying any downloads
# by name, the downloads with "default=true" are downloaded.

# This should usually be the latest release.
current-release: 0.0.1

# An integer indicating what models the current MHCflurryII code base is compatible
# with. Increment this integer when changes are made to MHCflurry that would break
# the use of previously released models.
current-compatibility-version: 1

# Add new releases here as they are made.
